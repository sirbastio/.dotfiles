## Built for flow

> **Minimal at the core. Powerful at the edges.**
>
> This configuration stays close to native Vim behavior, then layers in the things that make everyday editing faster: intelligent completion, project-wide search, clean buffer management, persistent context, and a fully integrated Git workflow.

- **Native muscle memory** — familiar motions and modes with focused quality-of-life improvements.
- **Fast by default** — plugins load lazily and configuration is split by concern.
- **Quietly intelligent** — LSP, completion, diagnostics, formatting, spelling, and Copilot are there when needed.
- **Visually cohesive** — every major surface is tuned around GitHub Dark Default.

## What makes it different

### Preview buffers that clean up after themselves

Opening a file marks it as a temporary preview with a `◌` in the buffer line. Open another file without touching the first and the old preview disappears automatically—similar to preview tabs in VS Code.

```text
open file A ◌  →  open file B ◌  →  file A closes
                         │
                         ├── edit or save  →  file B stays
                         └── <leader>bp    →  file B is pinned
```

The result is a buffer list that stays useful instead of becoming a graveyard. The implementation lives in [`lua/plugins/buffers.lua`](./lua/plugins/buffers.lua).

### File context that survives restarts

Cursor position and fold state are saved when a file leaves the window and restored when it returns. Diff views are deliberately excluded so CodeDiff can manage its own layout without interference.

### An interface that adapts

- The Snacks picker switches between wide and vertical layouts based on available width.
- The statusline collapses gracefully in narrow windows.
- Tree-sitter folds, context, and rainbow delimiters share a consistent visual language.
- Notifications, diagnostics, pickers, Git views, and floating windows use custom theme overrides.

## Daily controls

`<leader>` is <kbd>Space</kbd>. Plugin-specific mappings live beside their implementations in [`lua/plugins`](./lua/plugins); global mappings live in [`lua/config/keymaps.lua`](./lua/config/keymaps.lua).

| Area | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mode | `jk` or `esc` | Leave insert mode |
| Files | `⌘P` | Smart project picker |
| Files | `<leader>pw` | Search text across the project |
| Explorer | `<leader>e` / `<leader>E` | Open Mini Files at the working directory / current file |
| Explorer | `-` | Open the parent directory with Oil |
| Buffers | `<leader>bp` / `<leader>bd` | Pin or close the current buffer |
| Buffers | `⌘1` … `⌘5` | Jump directly to a buffer |
| Editing | `<leader>f` | Format the file or selection |
| Editing | `<leader>p` | Paste over a selection without replacing the register |
| Windows | `<leader>s` / `<leader>S` | Open a vertical / horizontal split |
| Windows | `Ctrl` + `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move between splits |
| Git | `<leader>gg` / `<leader>gG` | Open Neogit / Lazygit |
| Git | `<leader>gh` | Preview the current Git hunk |
| Diagnostics | `X` / `<leader>xx` | Inspect the current line / project diagnostics |
| Tools | `<leader>tt` / `<leader>u` | Toggle the terminal / undo tree |

Centered scrolling, search-result recentering, movable visual selections, selection-preserving indentation, and black-hole delete mappings are also configured globally.

## Defaults

- System clipboard integration and persistent undo history.
- Relative line numbers, a fixed sign column, and ten lines of scroll context.
- Smart-case searching and centered search navigation.
- Tree-sitter-powered folds that start open and persist per file.
- Right-opening vertical splits and below-opening horizontal splits.
- No swap files, backup files, line wrapping, or redundant mode display.
- Hyphenated identifiers are treated as complete words.
- True-color rendering and a blinking cursor that makes stalled SSH sessions obvious.

## Plugin map

Plugins are managed by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) and grouped by responsibility rather than loaded from one giant file.

## First launch

The main [bootstrap script](../../scripts/bootstrap.sh) installs Neovim and links this configuration with GNU Stow:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
nvim
```

On first launch, Neovim bootstraps lazy.nvim, installs the plugin graph, downloads the configured Tree-sitter parsers, and provisions Lua tooling through Mason.

> [!NOTE]
> A Nerd Font is strongly recommended. The configuration uses icons throughout the buffer line, statusline, pickers, diagnostics, and file explorers.

Useful maintenance commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `:Lazy` | Inspect, update, profile, or clean plugins |
| `:Mason` | Inspect installed language servers and tools |
| `:TSUpdate` | Update Tree-sitter parsers |
| `:checkhealth` | Check Neovim and provider health |
| `:ConformInfo` | Inspect formatters available to the current buffer |
